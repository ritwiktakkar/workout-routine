Workout Routine

This program generates a user-specified workout routine, and displays it on a GUI as well as stores it inside a .txt file. The program automatically checks what equipment is available from the user input and outputs routines based on that information. Furthermore, the program orders exercises based on muscles worked and allows users to customize the volume scheme.
